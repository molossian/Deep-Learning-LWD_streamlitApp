# Deep-Learning-LWD_streamlitApp
The streamlit app presents, shows and runs as an example the deep learning workflow implemented for the automated analysis of LWD borehole images. This images  are crucial for a proper well planning and decision making in operational stages during drilling. DL can accelerate the semiautomation of this process.
